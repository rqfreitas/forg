# ðŸ—‚ forg
Simple File & Folder Organazer in python. Based on Kalle Hallden snippet.


 
 ## Installing
 ```
 pip install forg
 ```
 ## How It Works
 
- Choose any folder from terminal.
- Run the command(from inside of the chosen folder):

``` 
forg


 It creates a folder called forg inside the current page, and based in a list of file extension, it creates subfolders in forg and move files there categorizing them by type.
 
 This is useful when your folder is a mess and you want to organize clearly your files.
